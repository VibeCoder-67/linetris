## What is Linera?

Linera is a Web3 protocol that scales by splitting state and execution across many **microchains** that all share the same validator set and security. Instead of a single global blockchain, Linera lets you create chains on demand—often one per user or per app—which can exchange messages asynchronously. Applications run as WebAssembly (Wasm) modules, typically authored in **Rust** (backend) and **TypeScript** (frontend), and are queried via **GraphQL**.

### Key properties

*   **Microchains**: Lightweight chains of blocks, each owned by one or more users or made public. Creating a new microchain costs one transaction on an existing chain.
*   **Shared security**: All microchains are secured by the same validators.
*   **Asynchronous cross-chain messaging**: Chains exchange messages via per‑pair inboxes with preserved order.
*   **Wallet-driven blocks**: Wallets don’t just sign transactions; they **propose blocks** to extend their chains.
*   **Two-part apps**: A gas‑metered **contract** that mutates state and a non‑metered **service** that answers read‑only GraphQL queries.

---

## Core Concepts

### Microchains at a glance

A **microchain** is a sequence of blocks that modifies shared state. There can be arbitrarily many microchains in one network.

*   **Single‑owner**: One super-owner can propose fast‑round blocks with very low latency.
*   **Multi‑owner**: Several owners can propose blocks (multi‑leader rounds).
*   **Public**: Anyone may be able to propose blocks depending on configuration.

### Cross-chain messaging

Apps running on different microchains communicate via **asynchronous messages**:

*   Messages are delivered to the target chain’s **inbox**.
*   Ordering between any two chains is preserved.
*   Messages can carry **authentication** that propagates from the original block signer.

### Wallets

*   A developer wallet stores keys and the tracked subset of chains, and runs a local node that exposes **GraphQL**.
*   Default files: `wallet.json` (private wallet state), `keystore.json` (keys), `wallet.db` (storage).

### Node service

Running `linera service` starts a local node that:

*   Executes blocks for owned chains.
*   Exposes a **GraphQL API** + GraphiQL IDE at `http://localhost:8080`.
*   Serves per‑application endpoints: `/chains/<chain-id>/applications/<application-id>`.

## Setting Up: Testnet vs Local Net

### Latest public Testnet ("Conway")

```bash
linera wallet init --faucet https://faucet.testnet-conway.linera.net
linera wallet request-chain --faucet https://faucet.testnet-conway.linera.net
```

### Local development network

Start a single‑validator local net with a faucet:

```bash
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080
```

Create a developer wallet and a chain using the faucet:

```bash
linera wallet init --faucet http://localhost:8080
linera wallet request-chain --faucet http://localhost:8080
```

---

## CLI Reference (Common Tasks)

### Inspect & manage chains

```bash
# List chains in the current wallet (default chain is green)
linera wallet show

# Set default chain
linera wallet set-default <chain-id>

# Open a new chain for yourself
linera open-chain
```

### Run the node service (GraphQL)

```bash
linera service --port 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080 for GraphiQL
```

---

## Example 1: The Counter (Basic Smart Contract)

This example demonstrates the fundamental structure of a Linera application using a simple Counter. It focuses on the **Rust** implementation.

### 1. Scaffold a project

```bash
linera project new my-counter
```

This creates `src/lib.rs` (ABI), `src/state.rs` (State), `src/contract.rs` (Logic), and `src/service.rs` (API).

### 2. Model the state (`src/state.rs`)

We use `RegisterView` to store a single value.

```rust
#[derive(RootView, async_graphql::SimpleObject)]
#[view(context = ViewStorageContext)]
pub struct Counter {
    pub value: RegisterView<u64>,
}
```

### 3. Define the ABI (`src/lib.rs`)

The ABI defines the operations (mutations) and queries available.

```rust
pub struct CounterAbi;

impl ContractAbi for CounterAbi {
    type Operation = u64;      // The operation is just a number (the increment amount)
    type Response  = u64;      // Returns the new value
}

impl ServiceAbi for CounterAbi {
    type Query         = async_graphql::Request;
    type QueryResponse = async_graphql::Response;
}
```

### 4. Implement the contract (`src/contract.rs`)

The contract handles the **write** logic. It is gas-metered and deterministic.

```rust
linera_sdk::contract!(CounterContract);

// ... struct definition ...

#[async_trait]
impl Contract for CounterContract {
    type Message = ();
    type InstantiationArgument = u64; // Initial value

    async fn instantiate(&mut self, value: u64) {
        self.state.value.set(value);
    }

    async fn execute_operation(&mut self, inc: u64) -> u64 {
        let new_value = self.state.value.get() + inc;
        self.state.value.set(new_value);
        new_value
    }
    
    // ... other required methods (load, store, etc.) ...
}
```

### 5. Implement the service (`src/service.rs`)

The service handles the **read** logic via GraphQL.

```rust
linera_sdk::service!(CounterService);

#[async_trait]
impl Service for CounterService {
    async fn handle_query(&self, req: async_graphql::Request) -> async_graphql::Response {
        let schema = Schema::build(
            QueryRoot { value: *self.state.value.get() },
            MutationRoot { runtime: self.runtime.clone() },
            EmptySubscription,
        ).finish();
        schema.execute(req).await
    }
}

// Map GraphQL mutations to operations
#[async_graphql::Object]
impl MutationRoot {
    async fn increment(&self, value: u64) -> Vec<u8> {
        // This schedules the operation to be signed and included in a block
        self.runtime.schedule_operation(&value);
        vec![]
    }
}
```

## Example 2: Blackjack (Full DApp with Frontend)

This example demonstrates a production-ready DApp with a **React frontend**, **Dynamic Wallet** integration, and complex state management.

### Architecture Overview

*   **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
*   **Wallet**: Dynamic (Ethereum) -> Linera Adapter -> Linera Network.
*   **Contract**: Rust (Blackjack logic).
*   **Communication**: GraphQL (Queries for state, Mutations for actions).

### Smart Contract Highlights

Unlike the Counter, Blackjack has complex state and operations.

**Operations (`src/lib.rs`):**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize, GraphQLMutationRoot)]
pub enum Operation {
    Reset,
    StartGame { bet: u64 },
    Hit,
    Stand,
    RequestChips,
}
```

**Execution (`src/contract.rs`):**
The contract validates the signer and updates the player's specific game state.
```rust
async fn execute_operation(&mut self, operation: Self::Operation) -> Self::Response {
    let signer = self.runtime.authenticated_signer().expect("Signer required");
    let mut player = self.state.players.load_entry_mut(&signer).await.expect("Failed to load player");

    match operation {
        Operation::Hit => {
            if let Err(e) = Self::hit(player, &mut self.runtime) { panic!("{}", e); }
        }
        // ... other operations
    }
    Self::Response::default()
}
```

## Dynamic Wallet Integration

LineraBet uses a custom adapter to bridge Ethereum wallets (via Dynamic) to the Linera network.

### 1. The `DynamicSigner` (`src/lib/dynamic-signer.ts`)

This class implements the Linera `Signer` interface. It intercepts the signing request and uses the Ethereum wallet's `personal_sign` method.

**Critical Implementation Detail:**
Linera passes *already hashed* bytes to the signer. Standard `signMessage` functions often hash the input again, causing a "double hash" mismatch. We must use `personal_sign` directly or ensure we are signing raw bytes.

```typescript
async sign(owner: string, value: Uint8Array): Promise<string> {
    const msgHex: `0x${string}` = `0x${uint8ArrayToHex(value)}`;
    
    // Use personal_sign to avoid double-hashing issues
    const walletClient = await this.dynamicWallet.getWalletClient();
    return await walletClient.request({
        method: "personal_sign",
        params: [msgHex, address],
    });
}
```

### 2. The `LineraAdapter` (`src/lib/linera-adapter.ts`)

This singleton manages the lifecycle of the Linera client.

*   **Connect**: Initializes WASM, connects to Faucet, creates a Wallet, and attaches the `DynamicSigner`.
*   **Query**: Sends GraphQL queries to the application.
*   **Persist**: Maintains connection state across the app.

```typescript
// Connecting
const signer = await new DynamicSigner(dynamicWallet);
const client = await new Client(wallet, signer);

// Querying
const result = await this.application.query(JSON.stringify({ query }));
```

## Deployment & Workflow

### 1. Build the Contract

```bash
cd contracts/blackjack
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### 2. Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Ensure you are in the root directory
linera publish-and-create \
  contracts/blackjack/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contracts_contract.wasm \
  contracts/blackjack/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contracts_service.wasm \
  --json-argument '{"starting_balance": 100, "random_seed": 0}'
```

### 3. Connect Frontend

1.  Copy the **Application ID** from the deployment output.
2.  Update `BLACKJACK_APP_ID` in `src/pages/blackjack.tsx`.
3.  Reload the frontend.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### "Blob not found"
*   **Cause**: The validator hasn't received the contract bytecode yet, or you are connected to the wrong network.
*   **Fix**: Run `linera sync --chain <CHAIN_ID>` or wait a few seconds. Ensure your `.env` points to the correct Faucet URL.

### "The block timestamp is in the future"
*   **Cause**: System clock drift.
*   **Fix**: Sync your system time (Settings -> Date & Time -> Sync Now).

### "Signature Invalid" / "Invalid Signer"
*   **Cause**: Double-hashing in the signer or mismatch between the wallet address and the signer address.
*   **Fix**: Ensure `DynamicSigner` uses `personal_sign` and that the `owner` matches the connected wallet.

### "Unknown type 'Owner'" in GraphQL
*   **Cause**: Using `Owner` type directly in GraphQL queries where `AccountOwner` is expected by the generated schema.
*   **Fix**: Check the schema (GraphiQL) and use the correct type (usually `AccountOwner` for Linera 0.12+).
